And this is why Hillary Clinton never could. Russian President Vladimir Putin expressed his bewilderment at why European countries were taking in so many migrants given the increasing number of rapes sweeping the continent, asserting that a society which cannot protect its children “has no future”. Putin made reference to a story out of Austria where an Iraqi migrant was not punished for raping a 10-year-old boy at a swimming pool in Vienna after he claimed it was a “sexual emergency” and that he didn’t understand the boy didn’t want to be raped. “I can’t even explain the rationale – is it a sense of guilt before the illegal alien Muslim migrants? A society that cannot defend its children today has no tomorrow, it has no future,” warned Putin, adding that he would not look to Europe for advice on Russia’s immigration policy given the situation that is unfolding there.
