Hillary Clinton appeared to stumble or nearly miss a step as she boarded her campaign plane on Thursday. 
Clinton was flying to a rally in Winston Salem, North Carolina when she boarded in rainy weather. 
From the time she departed her motorcade van, which was positioned right at the bottom of the stairs, all the way to the top of the steps, she appeared to be wobbly and unsteady, and laboring during the trek. 
Maybe it was because she had the extra — arduous — task of carrying an umbrella? 
Live Satellite News, which posted the video, noted she was “mumbling to herself.” 
Yesterday, she required assistance going up one step onto a riser to greet supporters in Lake Worth, Florida. 
She needed assistance to get onto it as she could be seen reaching her hand out for a boost or some added steadiness.
