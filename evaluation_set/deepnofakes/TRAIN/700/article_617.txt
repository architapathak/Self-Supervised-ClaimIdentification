Some Evidence is coming out regarding the handling of the investigation of Hillary Clinton’s private server. A frequent donor of the Clinton’s has donated a substantial amount of money to the wife of the FBI agent responsible for Hillary’s case. The FBI’s investigation found that Hillary was innocent of any crimes. Wonder why. 

Let me just start by saying that this is the single worst crime a person running for President in the US has EVER been convicted of. Hillary Clinton was just proven beyond any doubt to have been directly involved with the bribing and promoting of a top FBI agent during her own email trial. 

Let me break this down for you: 

Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe, one of Bill and Hillary Clinton’s most consistent backers, donated nearly $500,000 to the Virginia state Senate campaign of a candidate (Dr. Jill McCabe) who is married to the FBI’s deputy director.

McCabe’s husband, Andrew McCabe, was the associate deputy of the FBI’s Washington field office, which was tasked with investigating Hillary’s emails. 

This is where it gets really interesting. Sometime between the donation being made and the beginning of Clinton’s email investigation, McCabe was promoted to the Deputy Director of that office, giving him full control of the Clinton investigation.
