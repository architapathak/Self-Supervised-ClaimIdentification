A grim new Ministry of Defense ( MoD ) report circulating in the Kremlin today states that intelligence analysts of the System of Forward-looking Military Research and Development ( SFLMRD ) have now placed the United States in the “ active zone ” of nations currently undergoing a “ Colour Revolution ” as both US and EU elites have united to topple the soon to come government of President-elect Donald Trump.

According to this report, SFLMRD intelligence analysts are tasked with using “ modern/sophisticated ” technologies to ensure and protect the Federation’s national security interests—and of which the MoD has previously identified “ Colour Revolutions ” as being one of the gravest threats, not only to Russia, but the entire world.

During the MoD’s 2014 meeting of the Moscow Conference on International Security , this report explains, Federation military commanders labeled “ Colour Revolutions ” as a new US and European approach to warfare that focuses on creating destabilizing revolutions in other nations as a means of serving their security interests at low cost and with minimal casualties .

The some of first of these Western “ Colour Revolutions ” to be unleashed on an unsuspecting world, this report continues, was in 2003 when the legitimately elected democratic government of Georgia was overthrown in what was called the “ Rose Revolution ”—and that turned this once peaceful nation into a Western military puppet who, in 2008, launched an unprovoked attack against the Federation , but that was quickly and decisively defeated.
