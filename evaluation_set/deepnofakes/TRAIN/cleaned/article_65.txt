On Tuesday, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump received the endorsement of the Bay of Pigs Veterans Association in Miami, the first such endorsement in the history of the anti-communist group. “Our decision was a no-brainer,” a representative of the veterans group said in his introduction to the candidate, noting that the group had become increasingly concerned that “corruption in our public life has become rampant and has to be stopped,” and that they could not trust the “socialist progressive agenda of Hillary Clinton.”

 

“We only ask of Mr. Trump that the fundamental values animating his campaign – to restore truth and justice in our political system and public life – be deemed equally necessary for the oppressed people of Cuba in their struggle to be free,” he added.



Taking the podium to chants of “USA! USA!”, Trump said he was “humbled by this endorsement from true freedom fighters” and recognized the Damas de Blanco (Ladies in White), a Cuban dissident organization composed of the wives, mothers, daughters, and sisters of political prisoners. “They march quietly to church every Sunday and… are subject to physical and verbal violence and abuse by government-sanctioned mobs,” Trump noted, adding that Clinton “turns a blind eye to the human rights violations that occur every single day.”
